# AI-Javascript meetup

So... you wanna train a neural net?

[Brain.js](https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js) makes it SUPER easy. The docs are great - go have a read!


## Geting started

Remember to install your dependecies:


```bash
npm install
```

Then you can train the model with:


```bash
npm run train
```

## Usage

The repo currently uses multi-label training data from: 
```

```
Some single label data is included as well.

Hunting for some other data to use?

Kaggle has some nice data: https://www.kaggle.com/fabdelja/tictactoe
